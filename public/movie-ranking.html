<h1>The Greatest Movies of All Time According to Marcus</h1>
<h2>My Top Movies</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers</h3>
<p>This is the film picking up after the Fellowship has been broken, forcibly gone their seperate ways. Some are looking for the others while two remain true to their original objective.
    This film captures the emotion of each character as well as shows the camaraderie that transends race and time. Everything is visually stunning and the story told is one
    that most can relate to.

<h3>Princess Mononoke</h3>
<p>My personal anime favorite, this film shows how one person can make a difference in trying times. They don't have to be the greatest that ever was, they don't have to
    be the smartest, they just have to persevere and stay true to their conviction.
</p>
<h3>The Other Guys</h3>
<p>In my opinion, one of the funniest movies of all time. My friends and I still quote this movie to each other and we will take time out of our schedules to rewatch
    this classic of a film. The comedy has perfect timing, the irony of everything that happens as well as the action sequences makes this so memorable.
